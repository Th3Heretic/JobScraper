# <u><h1>JobScraper</h1></u>
<p>A web scraper project that works by accepting a URL input from the user that contains a job listing, the 
program then grabs the Job details and stores it in a spreadsheet for later reference.</p>

# <h2>Important Notice:</h2>
<p>LinkedIn’s ToS prohibits scraping without explicit permission. For long-term use or deployment, 
consider alternatives like LinkedIn’s API (requires approval) or integrating with legitimate job 
aggregator APIs like Indeed’s API.</p>
